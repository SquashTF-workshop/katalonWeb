Welcome to Squash TF components documentation!¶


Squash Test Factory (aka Squash TF) is a set of components whose purpose is to help you run your project’s
automated tests related to Squash TM (Squash Test Management) test cases.
Squash TF provide :

Runners : They manage the link between Squash TM test cases and the automated tests
An execution server : To handle the execution of automated tests drove by our runners



Runners¶
The Squash TF runners should be able to

manage the test suites to execute
launch the tests executions
manage the reports creation
when linked with Squash TM
report tests execution status to Squash TM
send execution reports URL to Squash TM


list all the automated tests of the project

For now, the following runners are available :

Squash TF Java Junit Runner
Squash TF Cucumber Java Runner
Squash TF Robot Framework Runner
Squash TF UFT Runner (Commercial Runner)
Squash TF Ranorex Runner (Commercial Runner)

Some other runners will come. The final aim is : Whatever technology you choose to implement your automated tests, we want to be able to execute them in Squash TF Execution Server.



Execution Server¶
The execution server is based on jenkins and its distributed build capabilities (for multi environments execution).
Use Jenkins bring us :

all the features of the jenkins ecosystem ( scm connectors, master/agent mode, pipeline, …)
facilitate the integration in CI/CD pipelines

We distribute Squash TF Execution Server in two ways:

as installer for windows and linux
as docker image for linux
